# nateTech-2026

## Project Overview
This directory serves as a **Personal Knowledge Base (PKB)** and **Study Plan** for technical growth in 2026. It is designed to be managed with **Obsidian** and focuses on advanced Frontend engineering, Rust programming, Web3/Blockchain, and AI engineering.

**Primary Goals:**
1.  **Frontend Mastery:** Deep dive into frameworks, architecture, and performance.
2.  **Rust Proficiency:** Learning Rust for system programming and frontend tooling (Wasm, SWC).
3.  **Web3 & Blockchain:** Understanding decentralized technologies.
4.  **AI Engineering:** Applying AI/LLMs in engineering workflows.

## Directory Structure

*   **`.obsidian/`**: Configuration for the Obsidian vault, including plugins (Kanban, Excalidraw, Dataview, Git, etc.) and themes.
*   **`前端体系/`** (Frontend System): Comprehensive knowledge base for Frontend Engineering.
    *   `前端体系脑图.md`: A structured outline of the frontend knowledge system (Languages, Frameworks, Engineering, Performance, etc.).
    *   `ECMAScript/`: Detailed documentation on ECMAScript standards (e.g., `Ecmascript标准规范.md`).
*   **`Rust体系/`** (Rust System): Resources and notes for learning the Rust programming language.
    *   `Rust体系脑图.md`: Structured outline for Rust learning.
*   **`TaskNotes/`**: Task management, daily logs, and project tracking.
*   **`Excalidraw/`**: Visual diagrams and mind maps created with the Excalidraw plugin.

## Key Files

*   **`前端体系/前端体系脑图.md`**: The central roadmap and knowledge tree for Frontend expertise.
*   **`前端体系/ECMAScript/Ecmascript标准规范.md`**: A comprehensive guide to ECMA-262 standards, covering history, syntax, execution mechanics, and new features up to ES2024.
*   **`前端体系.excalidraw.md`**: The visual representation of the frontend knowledge graph.
*   **`未命名.md`** (Study Plan): The 2026 Annual Study Plan, detailing quarterly goals (Q1-Q4) across all technical domains.

## Usage

This is a **Non-Code Project** intended for knowledge management.

1.  **Obsidian**: Open this directory as a Vault in Obsidian for the best experience.
2.  **Navigation**: Use the "Mind Map" (`脑图`) files as indexes to navigate specific topics.
3.  **Visualization**: Use the Excalidraw plugin to view and edit `.excalidraw.md` files.
4.  **Tracking**: Use the study plan to track progress against Q1-Q4 milestones.
